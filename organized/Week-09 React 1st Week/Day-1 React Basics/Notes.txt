Notes: 

- React is just an easier way to write normal HTML/CSS/JS. It’s a new syntax, that under the hood gets converted to HTML/CSS/JS.

1. Why React?
    - People realised it’s harder to do DOM manipulation the conventional way.
    - There were libraries that came into the picture that made it slightly easy, but still for a very big app it’s very hard (JQuery).
    - Eventually, VueJS/React created a new syntax to do frontends.
    - Under the hood, the react compiler convert your code to HTML/CSS/JS.

2. State & Components:
    - To create a react app, you usually need to worry about two things. Creators of frontend frameworks realised that all websites can effectively be divided into two parts :
        i. State
        ii. Component 

3. State / Component Re-rendering: 
    i. State : 
        - Everything in a website that changes is a state. An object that represents the current state of the app.
        - It represents the dynamic things in your app (things that change).
        - For example, the value of the counter.
    
    ii. Components :
        - How a DOM element should render, given a state.
        - It is a re-usable, dynamic, HTML snippet that changes given the state.
        - This button is a component. It takes the state (currentCount) as an input and is supposed to render accordingly.
    
    iii. A state change triggers a re-render. A re-render represents the actual DOM being manipulated, when the state changes.

    iv. You usually have to deﬁne all your components once, and then all you have to do is update the state of your app, React takes care of re-rendering your app.

4. JSX :
    - JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML like code in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
