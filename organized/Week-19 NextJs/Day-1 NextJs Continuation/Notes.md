## 1. Backend in Next.js

Next.js is a full stack framework. This means the same process can handle frontend and backend code. It is a React-based framework that enables developers to build fast, scalable, and production-ready web applications. It simplifies building modern web apps by offering tools and features that address common challenges in React development, such as routing, server-side rendering (SSR), and static site generation (SSG).

### Core Features of Next.js

1. **File-based Routing**: Previously, it automatically generated routes based on the file structure in the `pages` directory. However, in Next.js 13 and later versions, file-based routing has undergone a significant change with the introduction of the App Router. This new routing system is part of the move towards a more React Server Components-oriented architecture. Instead of using the `pages` directory for routing, Next.js now encourages the use of the `app` directory.

2. **Server-Side Rendering**: Dynamically generates HTML for every request on the server.

3. **Static Site Generation**: Pre-generates HTML pages at build time for better performance and SEO.

4. **API Routes**: Enables building serverless API endpoints in the same project.

5. **Client-Side Rendering**: Provides flexibility to render components in the browser for dynamic interactions.

6. **Image Optimization**: Improves image loading with the `next/image` component, including automatic resizing and lazy loading.

7. **Built-in CSS and Sass Support**: Seamlessly supports global and module-based CSS styling.

8. **TypeScript Support**: Offers first-class TypeScript support for robust type checking.

9. **Middleware**: Adds powerful request/response handling at the edge using middleware.

10. **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Updates static content without a full rebuild, ensuring content freshness.

## 2. What is the Difference Between `Response` and `NextResponse`?

`NextResponse` is a Next.js-specific helper that provides extended functionality over the standard `Response` object. It is primarily used in middleware and API routes to manipulate responses, perform redirects, rewrite URLs, or modify headers.

### Features of `NextResponse`
- Redirects users to a different URL.
- Rewrites requests to a different URL or path.
- Sets custom headers.
- Supports middleware-specific responses.

The `Response` object is part of the Fetch API and is available globally in JavaScript. In Next.js, it can also be used in API routes or middleware to create and manipulate responses.

## 3. What is the Difference Between `export` and `export default`?

- `export`: Used to export multiple variables, functions, or objects from a module. When importing, you must use the exact names of the exported items. Allows for multiple exports from a single file.

- `export default`: Allows you to export a single value, function, or class from a module. When importing, you can use any name for the imported item. Used when a file primarily exports one main item.
