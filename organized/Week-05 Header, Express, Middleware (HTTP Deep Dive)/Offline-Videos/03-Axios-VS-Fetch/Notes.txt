Notes:
Difference between the both -
    - Axios will automatically transforms the server's response data, while with Fetch, you need to call the response. 
    - Axios me we don't need to parse the data using response.json()
    - Json method to parse the data into a JavaScript object.
    - Here we have to parse the data with response.json()
