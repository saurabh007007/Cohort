1. Why do we need CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)?
Ans:    - Every website has its frontend and backend part, frontend part like - https//google.com and backend part like - https//api.google.com
        - Ab yeh frontend part includes html,css,js react,js codes.
        - and backend part includes the server side code like the node.js , express codes
        - ab as a developer ham toh yeh hi chahnge ki google.com ka frontend, google ke backend api.google.com ko connect na ki google.com kisi aur suppose api.hdfcbank.com ko connect kare 
        - for this CORS is required and by default node.js mein CORS disabled hota hai.


2. cors (Cross origin resource sharing): 
        - It is a security feature implemented by web browsers that controls how resources on a web server can be requested from another domain. 
        - It's a crucial mechanism for managing `cross-origin` requests and ensuring secure interactions between `different origins` on the web.
        - cors is used to connect the frontend and backend which had different url/domain but if the backend and the frontend is deployed in the same domain then this cors is not required.
